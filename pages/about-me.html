            <p class="history">
                This is my story and how I came to connect with the world of music.
                My name is Nathael Bellezza. I was born on December 26, 1994 in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
                I never really felt a connection to the musical world, I spent my teenage years looking for what I was
                good at, what I wanted to do and what I was passionate about.
                I hit the wall many times, in careers and jobs that were for me, that bored me and stressed too much.
                One day a friend lent me his acoustic guitar.
                That day, that guitar, was the one that changed everything for me.
                I got to know a new world, a world in which I could disconnect and let myself flow through my senses. I
                started playing every day, 8 hours a day.
                Until one day I felt stuck in what I was learning, so I decided to become a professional, I started
                studying at a music institute.
                I started to be interested in singing and other instruments and here I am, developing myself and as a
                person.
                Knowing this world was the best thing that happened to me in my life. It was the right decision.
